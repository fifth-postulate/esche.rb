# esche.rb
Presentation for the [Amsterdam.rb][] meetup of 17 April.

## Inspiration
This talk is heavily inspired by the excellent workshop [Escher in Elm][escher-in-elm] by the awesome [Einar Host][host]. His workshop in turn was based on the 1982 classic paper [functional geometry][funcgeo], or at least the revision from 2002.
